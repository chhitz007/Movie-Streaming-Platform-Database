# ðŸŽ¬ Movie/Streaming Platform Database (PostgreSQL)

## Overview

This repository contains a **Movie/Streaming Platform Database** project built in **PostgreSQL**. It demonstrates **database design, query writing, and reporting** using realistic dummy data. The project is designed for **SQL Developer / Database roles** and showcases hands-on skills in **joins, aggregations, subqueries, window functions, views, and triggers**.

## Database Structure

The project includes **9 core tables**:

| Table               | Description                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `Users`             | Stores user details           |
| `Subscriptions`     | Different subscription plans  |
| `UserSubscriptions` | Maps users to subscriptions   |
| `Movies`            | Movie information             |
| `Actors`            | Actor details                 |
| `Genres`            | Movie genres                  |
| `MovieActors`       | Many-to-many: movies â†” actors |
| `MovieGenres`       | Many-to-many: movies â†” genres |
| `Ratings`           | Usersâ€™ ratings and reviews    |

* **Relationships:** One-to-many and many-to-many
* **Constraints:** Primary keys, foreign keys, unique, and check constraints
* **Optimization:** Indexing for faster queries

## Dataset

* Realistic dummy data for **20+ users, movies, actors, genres, and subscriptions**
* Includes **UserSubscriptions** with active/inactive plans
* Ratings simulate **user feedback for movies**

---

## Features & Skills Demonstrated

* **SQL Queries:**

  * Joins (inner, outer, self)
  * Aggregations & GROUP BY
  * Subqueries & correlated queries
  * Window functions (RANK, ROW\_NUMBER, cumulative aggregates)
  * Reporting queries (top movies, top users, trends)

* **Views:** Simplified reporting for dashboards

* **Data Management:** Backup, restore, and realistic test data

---

## Query Highlights

* Top 10 movies by rating
* Users with highest engagement
* Movies with multiple actors
* Active subscriptions per user

*(30+ queries organized from simple â†’ advanced, beginner-friendly to real-world analytics)*

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Movie-Streaming-Platform-Database.git
   ```

2. Open in **PostgreSQL** (pgAdmin or psql)

3. Execute `Schema.sql` to create tables

4. Execute `Data_Insertions` from the folder to populate tables

5. Explore queries in `Movie_db_queries.sql` or run your own SQL queries
